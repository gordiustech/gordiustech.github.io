<p>Even though a significant volume of modern-day trading is algorithmic, this volume is not diverse; it is mainly due to a few firms. Most individual and/or small-scale investors still do not have the means to engage in algorithmic trading. Our technology can help mitigate this situation and make algorithmic trading more accessible to all interested investors.</p>
<p>In order to prove our technology, we are currently using it ourselves to engage in algorithmic trading in cryptocurrency exchanges. If successful, this operation will also generate our first revenue stream.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1e4raqikl1">Industrial Internet of Things</h3>
<p>The ubiquity of IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things) edge devices has made the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_4.0">Industry 4.0</a> vision achievable, yet many small/mid-market businesses are not able to take advantage of this promising paradigm shift. We believe that this unfortunate situation is mainly due to the absence of a turnkey end-to-end system that these businesses can adopt with only a small amount of friction to their current day-to-day operations.</p>
<p>We hope to utilize our technology to enable small/mid-market businesses to take advantage of the Industry 4.0 paradigm.</p>

<p>We believe that high-efficiency stream processing, when driven by robust AI techniques, can be a game changing advantage for many businesses. At Gordius Technologies, we strive to develop a complete end-to-end system for processing, analyzing, storing and acting on high-throughput time-series data.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1e4r9jdch1">Focus Areas</h3>
<p>Our strategy is to introduce our technology into verticals where time-series data is the central "resource" or the "asset" of businesses. As a first step, we chose to focus on the algorithmic trading space. Our second focus area will be the IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things) space.</p>
