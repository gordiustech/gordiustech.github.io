Most individual and/or small-scale investors still do not have the means to engage in algorithmic trading. Our technology can help mitigate this situation and make algorithmic trading more accessible to all interested investors.</p>\n<p>In order to prove our technology, we are currently using it ourselves to engage in algorithmic trading in cryptocurrency exchanges. If successful, this operation will also generate our first revenue stream.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1e4raqikl1\">Industrial Internet of Things</h3>\n<p>The ubiquity of IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things) edge devices has made the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_4.0\">Industry 4.0</a> vision achievable, yet many small/mid-market businesses are not able to take advantage of this promising paradigm shift. We believe that this unfortunate situation is mainly due to the absence of a turnkey end-to-end system that these businesses can adopt with only a small amount of friction to their current day-to-day operations.</p>\n<p>We hope to utilize our technology to enable small/mid-market businesses to take advantage of the Industry 4.0 paradigm.</p>",
